emailvision Assignment
=====================

assignment for emailvision (requirejs, backbone, chaplin, bootstrap, jquery, handlebars)

Although the original request was just using backbone, I find that backbone is too basic, hence - very confusing as there's a lack of methodology of programming, unlike other framework such as AngularJS.
Hence, I'vebeen using chaplin in addition to form a bit of order in the app.

I've used bootstrap for the design (basically, it support less, but i didn't really add many other classes)
